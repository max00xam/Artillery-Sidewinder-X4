# 💡 Controlling Toolhead LED on Artillery Sidewinder X4 via MKS PI GPIO

This guide explains how to gain full control over the toolhead LED by bypassing internal MCU limitations and using the MKS PI host GPIOs directly.

## 🔍 1. Identify Your GPIO Pin
Before starting, confirm which pin controls your LED. While **GPIO 79** is standard for most X4 units, yours might differ.

1. **Connect via SSH** (User: `mks`, Pass: `makerbase`).
2. **Run the Monitor Command**:
   ```bash
   watch -n 0.5 "cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio*/value"
